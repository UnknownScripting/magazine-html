        <h1>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h1>
        <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</p>
        <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it. </p>
        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yperText <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
                
            HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
            
            In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The opening tag</li>
                <li>The closing tag</li>
                <li>The actual element</li>
            </ol>
